> We live in an age where people install npm packages like they’re popping pain killers.

Welcome to arguably the most useless repository on GitHub. Have you ever had a piece of text that you've wanted to absolutely ruin by decorating it in `(ノ*゜▽゜*) OwOs ヾ(´▽｀;)ゝ`? Me neither.

This is the solution to that critical problem. A CLI tool to show your developer friends just how `(｡-_-｡ )人( ｡-_-｡)` you are.

## Requirements

1. git
2. node

### Installation and Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jamie-legg/CLWhy && cd CLWhy`
npm i
npm run start #installs the ruin CLI globally
ruin <text> #produces ...something
```

Have fun, please don't contribute, this deserves no love or attention.
